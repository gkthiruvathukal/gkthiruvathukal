### Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I use GitHub for work empirical software engineering, software tools, and open access lecture notes and code examples for my classes
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be an effective department chairperson. (Wish me luck.)
- ðŸ‘¯ I enjoy collaboration and teamwork to solve challenging problems in computer science with a focus on software engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and distributed systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about research opportunities. We will start a **new doctoral program** at Loyola University Chicago in Computter Science and will be looking for motivated graduate students who are interested in research.
- ðŸ“« My main presence on the web is [gkt.sh](https://gkt.sh). I do not actively use social media but am on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gkthiruvathukal/).
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I am not coding or writing, I am either at the other keyboard (piano), cooking, or doing various home tasks. I often joke with my wife that my middle initial, K, stands for Kooking and Kleaning (in their misspelled versions).
